# CMS-Practical-4

# Learning Activities & Resources
The task, this week, was to set up a dynamic localhost website. Firstly, I installed XAMPP, which is an open-source software package that helps in the setup of a local web server environment for the purpose of web development and testing. During the installation of the software, I faced some issues. Since I am a Mac user and Windows is more commonly used, I got a message that the application that I downloaded is not safe to be used and it may pose some risks to the laptop. So, I went to System Preferences and changed the settings in the Security and Privacy section. Then, there was a pop-up window that came which completed the installation of all the required files. 

After that, when I tried running the MySQL Database, there was another issue as there was already one MySQL running in the background (from Database classes). Since only one of the programs can run at a time, I had to stop the already running MySQL program and run the XAMPP one. Upon completion of this step, I downloaded WordPress and opened the zip folder inside htdocs which is situated inside the XAMPP folder. 

Then, we were told to search: http://localhost/wordpress/ (the URL is different for Mac - without the version). After entering this, I was led to the initial setup screen of WordPress. Following this, we went to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ to create a new database called newdb.

# Estimated hours
The estimated time to complete the practical was 1.5 hours. 

# Content Insights
Despite the security and the database issues faced due to Mac and the Database Modelling module I had done before, I managed to manoeuvre around these problems.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I learnt that Mac has some extra messages that pop up when you download from the internet. I learnt that these can be resolved from settings and also that the software should be from an authentic website. I also learnt that two database programs cannot run together.
